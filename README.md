Phage2d is an open-source 2d java game engine using lwjgl, dyn4j, and many other libraries.

This engine is still in early developmental stages, so bugs may exist.

To use this engine, download the project source and import it into Eclipse as an existing project. Then, you can put your game source code into a new package.  As of right now, binary distributions are not available.

See the examples package for demo games, and make sure to read engine/core/Notes.txt.
