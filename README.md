Phage2d is an open-source 2d java game engine using lwjgl, dyn4j, and many other libraries.

Developement on this engine has been abandonded in favor of it's successor, big-phage (https://github.com/spfrommer/big-phage).

To use this engine, download the project source and import it into Eclipse as an existing project. Then, you can put your game source code into a new package.  As of right now, binary distributions are not available.

See the examples package for demo games, and make sure to read engine/core/Notes.txt.
