Additional notes:

Never use WrapperComponents to modify DataComponents directly - just provide a way for LogicComponents to access the DataComponents without worrying what type it is.
If you have a branch in your LogicComponents - say, a renderer that uses PhysicsData and one that uses ShellData - use WrapperComponents to abstract these differences.
When overriding a Component that isn't abstract, MAKE SURE YOU OVERRIDE THE COPY FUNCTION.  Otherwise, the parent component will use its copy function to return a more basic Component.
If you want to sync a Component over the network, make sure you provide either a DataEncoder or DependentEncoder for that Component and add it to the EncoderWrapper.
